The Neural Network has generated a new, "fake" TV script for a hypothetical Season 10 of the show. ;-)
        You are welcome to use this model to input your own dataset and it'll generate a new one for you.`,

        description : `A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that can classify the breed of dog from any user-supplied image. If the image is of a human and not of a dog, the algorithm will provide an estimate of the dog breed that is most resembling to the image.
        The code is written in Python 3 and Keras with Tensorflow backend all presented in Jupyter Notebook. I used AWS EC2 gpu instance for training the model. You can use Google Colab or the same EC2 instance.
        If you wish do some improvements or fix some typos or make the code better you are always welcome.`,

        A Sudoku Solver is a perfect blend of Web Development and Logical thinking (helps in competitive programming).
        You will learn:
        - Basic to Advanced HTML & CSS (up to CSS grids)
        - Logical thinking and figuring out an algorithm to solve sudokus
        - Javascript and recursive functions
        - DOM Manipulation
        - Writing modular code (essential if you aim to contribute in a big project)
        
        Check out the primary project here: https://tichnas.github.io/Sudoku-Solver/
        If time permits, we'll learn more by adding new features.`,
